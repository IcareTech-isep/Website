             <p>
                 Patients can fill out their own information to register their account, including their name, contact, medical history, and their emergency contact information. This information can also be added and modified after the patient logged in. The patient can view the data displayed by the sensor at any time, including the patient's heartbeat,  behavior, and so on. To determine whether the physical condition is abnormal. The patient can also check the doctor's advice at any time, including the patient's living habits and medical recommendations
            </p>
            <p>
                The doctor can also register the account and log in. He can check the patient's physical condition by looking at the data received by the sensor and give his own professional advice. At the same time, the doctor can obtain the patient's medical history in the patient's information, thereby giving more accurate medical recommendations.
            </p>
            <p>
                The admin is responsible for managing the operation of the entire system, because there can only be one administrator and therefore cannot register and can only log in. Administrators can also view data for all sensors, and he can view all information about adding and modifying patients and doctors, including removing a patient and doctor, and removing their rights to use the system. He is the manager of the entire system.
