             <p>
                 Patients can register to create an account and fill in their details, such as their name, contact, medical history, and their emergency contact information. This information can also be added and modified after the patient logged in.  <br>
                 The patient can view the health statistics collected by the sensor at any time. <br>
                 Data includes the patient's heartbeat, blood pressure, duration of sleep and activity(e.g. walking/jogging).  <br>
                 The patient can also check the doctor's comments on their recovery progress at any time<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                The doctor can not register an account by themselves. They must contact the admin for registration.
                Once that is completed they can log in with a temporary password. <br>
                At the same time, the doctor can obtain the patient's medical history in the patient's information, thereby giving more accurate medical recommendations. <br>
                He can check the patient's physical condition by looking at the data collected by the sensor. <br>
                He can provide comments on the patient's recovery progress as well as suggestions to the patient.<br>
                
            </p>
            <p>
                The admin is responsible for managing the operation of the entire system. <br>
                There will only be one administrator, whom will have an account created when the system is set up. <br>
                Administrators can view all data from the sensors, as well as the information on all the users. <br>
                Administrator also has the ability to remove patient and doctor accounts, and remove their rights to use the system. <br>
                He is the manager of the entire system and will be the person of contact if there is any issue. <br>
